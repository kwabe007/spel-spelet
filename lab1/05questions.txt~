What different constructors are invoked, and when?

- First, the 'some other constructor' gets called since it matches the parameter (char const* s) with
"my name is a".
The second one to get called is the copy-constructor since 'A b = a' is a copy initialization, e.g. it
copies the instance from the right to make a copy of it to the one on the right.
The third one also calls the copy-constructor, it matches A (A const& src).
The fourth one calls the default constructor since it has no arguments and it matches A ().
