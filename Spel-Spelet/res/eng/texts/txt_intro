You are some random guy who decided, for whatever reasons, to leave your beloved home of Kvarnam√•la to seek new adventures in the city of Stockholm. When you arrive at Stockholm you realize it's kind of shit but you can't return yet because your train back departs next month. So what now? You decide to go into the forest because you are not very bright but it doesn't matter, the forest could be fun.
Developer's Note: This is the best story I could come up with
