Biggo Mann
He seems super-intelligent, but also seem quite worried.
I am not the enemy you fool!
You seem trustworthy, stranger, so I will tell you my story. I am Biggo Mann, ruler of house TCS in the kingdom of CSC. There are four ruling families (or houses) governing our vast realm: TCS, CVAP, MID and CAS. Not until long ago all factions coexisted in balance. That was before [insert super badass nickname or sum shit here] appeared. He started out as a lecturer in house MID and rose to power by his insatiable hunger for CSC-wide dominance. He and his followers took over the houses of CVAP and CAS without much resistance. House TCS is now the last standing faction to oppose [insert badass name again here] and his legion. You must aid us or the kingdom of CSC will be no more.
